**Abstract**: A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) describes, in a structured, machine-readable format, the open-source and proprietary components that constitute a software product, including their licenses, versions, vendors, vulnerabilities, and dependency relationships. SBOMs enable practitioners to gain visibility into the software supply chain and monitor any risks associated with software security, licensing, and more. In this industry paper, we present the findings of 10 semi-structured interviews with practitioners with different roles in six different software companies operating in Italy, some of which being very large multinationals. The gathered information indicates that the adoption of SBOMs is low, yet the attention of the software industry to software supply chain-related challenges is high. A possible reason behind this outcome is that the software industry has limited knowledge of SBOMs and software supply chain regulations. Although some participants showed a growing interest in SBOMs, the Italian software industry seems to respond less promptly to this technology. We plan to use these results and those from past research to design a survey with practitioners to have a complete picture of SBOM usage in the software industry.
