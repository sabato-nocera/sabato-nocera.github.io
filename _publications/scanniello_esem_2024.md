**Abstract**: MSR4SBOM (Mining Software Repositories for enhanced Software Bills of Materials) is a project whose main goal is to deliver a framework that analyzes the content of software repositories and SBOMs to provide context-sensitive recommendations. The expected outputs are (i) a set of approaches and tools released as open-source projects, making them exploitable in industrial, academic, and open-source contexts; and (ii) replication packages of our empirical studies and repositories of datasets collected while developing, calibrating, and validating the MSR4SBOM approaches and tools.
