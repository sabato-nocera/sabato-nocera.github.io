Hi! I am Sabato Nocera, a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Salerno](https://web.unisa.it/en/university), Italy. I received my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from the same university in September 2022 and 2020, respectively. My research interests are in **Empirical Software Engineering** and involve **Software Security** and **Software Supply Chain**.
