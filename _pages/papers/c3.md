## Abstract

Background: Software vulnerabilities are flaws in application source code that can be exploited to cause harm, hence companies must devise strategies to manage them.Aim: We want to understand how software vulnerabilities are managed in a big IT (Information Technology) service and consulting company like NTT Data.Method: We conducted a focus group involving six software professionals working at NTT Data and analyzed the gathered data through a thematic analysis approach.Results: We found that application security standards are defined based on the needs of the clients (i.e., companies that commissioned NTT Data the software to be developed) and the projects’ nature (i.e., the development of greenfield projects vs. maintenance of existing ones). Also, to detect software vulnerabilities, SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools are mainly used; among these, SonarLint and SonarQube appear to be the de-facto standards for NTT Data. Finally, not all software vulnerabilities are fixed; for example, the presence of some software vulnerabilities is tolerated by the clients, who take on the responsibility of not removing these vulnerabilities.Conclusions: It seems that developers and NTT Data clients are not averse to securing their code. NTT Data follows the application security standards established with their clients. To detect software vulnerabilities, SonarLint and SonarQube appear to be the de-facto standards, so explaining to some extent the increasing attention on these tools by the software engineering research community.
